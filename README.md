# Tutorial/How to...

### What do you mean by the playlist?
The playlist is on the right side on UI, there you can see all music tracks that have been added by you (besides the song's name, you can also view the artist [if the artist has been added in the file's metadata]).

### How to add something to the playlist?
There are 4 ways to do that:
* Drag the audio file onto the playlist.

* Left-click on the "Add a folder" button inside the BluePlayer program and choose folder with audio songs that you want to add to the playlist.
