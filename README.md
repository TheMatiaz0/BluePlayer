The playlist is on the right side on UI, there you can see all music tracks that you have added (aside the name, you can view the artist too [if the artist has been added in audio's properties]).

### How to add something to playlist?
There are 3 ways to do that:
* Drag the audio file onto the playlist.

* Left-click on button "Get" inside the BluePlayer program and choose folder with audio songs you want to add to the playlist, next press "Add" button to finally add everything from the path into the playlist.
